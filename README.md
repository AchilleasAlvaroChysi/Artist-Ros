# Artist-Ros
## Goal
Our goal was to create a parallel arm manipulator mechanism, with 5DOF.
We modeled the robot arm using ROS environment and RViz for the visualization. 
The folder /src/urdf contains the arm description, written in xacro, meaning a XML file tha contains some macros.

## Execute
To execute our code do the following steps:
1. `cd catkin_ws/src`
2. `git clone <this_repo>`
3. `cd ..`
4. `catkin_make`
5. `source devel/setup.bash`
6. `roslaunch artist rviz.launch`
